# SpooNMAP

## Dependencies
This script is simply a wrapper for NMAP and Masscan. Install them from your
favorite package manager, or install from source.

The script also utilizes Python's magical f-strings, so Python 3.6 or above
is required.

## Usage
Again, make sure that you have Python 3.6 or above installed. Simply executing
the script will prompt you for all of the required scanning options.

```
# ./spoonmap.py

Scan Type
	(1) Small Port Scan
	(2) Medium Port Scan
	(3) Large Port Scan
	(4) Extra Large Port Scan (Small, Medium, and Large)
	(5) Full Port Scan
	(6) Custom Port Scan

What type of scan would you like to perform (default: Small Port Scan)? 

Would you like to enumerate service banners for any identified services (default: Yes)? 

Target Scan
	(1) External
	(2) Internal

Is this an internal or external scan (default: External)? 

How fast would you like to scan (default: 20000 packets/second)? 

Example Target File
One CIDR or IP Address per line

	192.168.0.0/24
	192.168.1.23

Please enter the full path for the file containing target hosts (default: /opt/spoonmap/ranges.txt): 

Would you like to exclude any hosts?  (default: No) 

Scan Type: Small Port Scan
Target Ports: ['80', '443', '8000', '8080', '8008', '8181', '8443']
Service Banner: False
Source Port: 53
Masscan Max Packet Rate (pps): 2000
Target File: ranges.txt
Exclusions File: exclusions.txt

Scanning port 80...
```
You can also create a configuration file to avoid all of the prompts. Use the
provided 'config.json.sample' as an example. Just make sure that your file 
is named 'config.json'
```
# cat config.json
{
    "__scan_type_choices__" : "Small Port Scan, Medium Port Scan, Large Port Scan, Extra Large Port Scan, Full Port Scan, Custom Port Scan", 
    "scan_type" : "Custom Port Scan", 
    "dest_ports" : ["80","443","8000","8080","U:53"],
    "__banner_scan_choices__" : "True, False", 
    "banner_scan" : "True", 
    "__target_scan_choices__" : "External, Internal", 
    "target_scan" : "Internal",
    "__max_rate_external_recommedation__" : "Single Port = 20000, Full Port = 10000", 
    "__max_rate_internal_recommedation__" : "Single Port = 2000, Full Port = 1000", 
    "max_rate" : "2000",
    "target_file" : "ranges.txt",
    "output_path" : "./",
    "exclusions_file" : "exclusions.txt"
}
```
Note: To perform UDP scans simply prepend 'U:' to the port you'd like to scan (i.e 'U:53').
#### config.json Parameters
##### scan_type
This paramater is used to determine what ports to scan.
* Small Port Scan
    * 80, 443, 8000, 8080, 8008, 8181, 8443
* Medium Port Scan
    * 7001, 1433, 445, 139, 21, 22, 23, 25, \
    53, 111, 389, 4243, 3389, 3306, 4786, \
    5900, 5901, 6379, 6970, 9100
* Large Port Scan
    * 1090, 1098, 1099, 10999, 11099, 11111, \
    3300, 4243, 4444, 4445, 45000, 45001, \
    47001, 47002, 4786, 4848, 50500, 5555, \
    5556, 6129, 6379, 6970, 7000, \
    7002, 7003, 7004, 7070, 7071, \
    8001, 8002, 8003, 8686, 9000, \
    9001, 9002, 9003, 9012, 9503
* Extra Large Port Scan
    * Small, Medium, and Large Ports Combined
* Full Port Scan
    * 1-65,535
* Custom Port Scan
    * Dealer's Choice
##### dest_ports
* Only used if 'Custom Port Scan' is selected.
##### banner_scan
This parameter is used to determine whether NMAP will be used
to grab service banners.
* True
* False
##### target_scan
This paramater is used to determine what source port to spoof.
* External Port Scan
    * source port = 53
* Internal Port Scan
    * source port = 88
##### max_rate
This parameter is used to determine how fast to scan in masscan.
If it is not set manually, it is determined from the
scan_type and target_scan parameters.
**Note: Selecting a max_rate that is too high can easily create
a denial-of-service. In my testing, the following rates have been
found to be safe. YMMV**
* 'External' and 'Common Port Scan'
    * max_rate = 20,000 packets/second
* 'External' and 'Full Port Scan'
    * max_rate = 10,000 packets/second
* 'Internal' and 'Common Port Scan'
    * max_rate = 2,000 packets/second
* 'Internal' and 'Full Port Scan'
    * max_rate = 1,000 packets/second
* Everything else
    * max_rate = 2,000 packets/second
